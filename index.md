## Brief career

My name is David Pérez, and I live in the sunny Barcelona (Spain).

I studied telecommunication engineering.  I was taught the `Pascal` language.  Of course, I've forgotten it.

I started programming professionally in plain `C` and assembler (microcontrollers) in the late 80's.  In the early 90's, I introduce C++ to my team.  I used to work in industrial environmnents, where reliability is important, and problems like memory leaks are easy to appear, as they work day and night.  I mastered this language, but realized it wasn't very productive when I began working with `.NET`, in the beta stages.  It was quite good for being beta, even the lack of documentation at that time.

`.NET` was inspired by `Java`, but started working seriously later.   Ever since, I've been working with open source technologies, and stop working with Microsoft Techmologies.  It has been an amazing experience, to start collaborating with people foreign to my company, and submit patches to projects like [iText](http://itextpdf.com/) or [Jython](http://www.jython.org/).

In 2007 I became a developer of [Qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/project/developers), a powerful Javascript framework at its time.

In the latest years, I'm very involved with [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) language and surrounding technologies like SBT, Spray, and Slick.  It's a natural transition from the Java world.  I'll talk about in future posts.

It's important to submit patches, and propose improvements to the authors, and if possible do it yourself.  In Internet, we can be passive consumers or actively change the world.

Nowadays, thanks to [github](http://github.com/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/), collaboration it's easier than never before.  So the  number of projects are increasing exponentially.
